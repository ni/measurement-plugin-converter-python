  ```

#### Prerequisites

- The Python measurement should have a measurement function.
- The measurement function should use at least one of the supported [instrument drivers](#supported-instrument-drivers) and [data types](#supported-data-types).
  The inputs and outputs of unsupported data types will be skipped.
- The measurement function must return a value through a variable. Assign the return value to a variable first, and then return that variable.
  Returning a function call or a constant value directly is not supported.

  ```py
  # Unsupported format
  def measurement() -> List[float]:
    # Measurement logic.
    return measure_voltages()

  # Supported format
  def measurement() -> List[float]:
    # Measurement logic.
    voltages = measure_voltages()
    return voltages
  ```

- The measurement function should have clear and accurate type hints for all input and output parameters.

  ```py
  # Unsupported format
  def measurement(voltage, current):
    # Measurement logic.
    resistance = voltage / current
    return resistance
  
  # Supported format
  def measurement(voltage: int, current: float) -> float:
    # Measurement logic.
    resistance = voltage / current
    return resistance
  ```

- The measurement function should have the instrument driverâ€™s session initialization within the measurement function, indented at the next level.

  ```py
  # Unsupported format
  def measurement(voltage: int, current: float) -> float:
    if voltage:
      with nidcpower.Session("DCPower1") as session:
        # Measurement logic.
        return current

  # Supported format
  def measurement(voltage: int, current: float) -> float:
    with nidcpower.Session("DCPower1") as session:
      # Measurement logic.
      return current
  ```

- The measurement function should consolidate all instrument driver session initializations at a single point using the `with` context manager.

  ```py
  # Unsupported format
  def measurement(voltage: int, current: float) -> float:
    with nidcpower.Session("DCPower1") as dcpower_session:
      with nidmm.Session("DMM1") as dmm_session:
        # Measurement logic.
        return current

  # Unsupported format
  def measurement(voltage: int, current: float) -> float:
    with nidcpower.Session("DCPower1") as dcpower_session:
        # Measurement logic.

    with nidmm.Session("DCPower1") as dmm_session:
        # Measurement logic.
    
    return current

  # Supported format
  def measurement(voltage: int, current: float) -> float:
    with nidcpower.Session("DCPower1") as dcpower_session, nidmm.Session("DMM1") as dmm_session:
      # Measurement logic.
      return current
  ```

#### Supported data types

- Integer
- Float
- String
- Boolean
- 1D array of the above types

#### Supported instrument drivers

- NI-DCPower
- NI-DMM
- NI-Digital Pattern Driver
- NI-FGEN
- NI-SWITCH
- NI-SCOPE
- NI-DAQmx
- NI-VISA

#### Additional steps for VISA instruments

For measurements that use VISA instruments, the `session_constructor`, session type and `instrument_type` must be updated with appropriate values.

![VISA_updates](docs/images/VISA_updates.png)

Steps to be followed

- Define the gRPC device server support.
- Define the session class for the instrument type.
- Define the session constructor for the instrument type.

  ![VISA_updated](docs/images/VISA_updated.png)

- For `session_constructor`, create SessionConstructor object of the instrument driver used.
- For `instrument_type`, use the pin map instrument type id.
- For session type, the type of session should be passed.

For details, refer [Examples](https://github.com/ni/measurement-plugin-python/tree/releases/2.1/examples/nivisa_dmm_measurement).

![VISA_examples](docs/images/VISA_examples.png)

#### Event logger

- The tool generates a log at the start of the conversion process, recording all actions performed throughout.
- The log file is located in the output directory.
- This log includes detailed information on any errors encountered during the process.

#### Limitations

- Class-based measurements are not supported for conversion.
- Data types such as `Path`, `Enum`, `DoubleXYData`, and their array variants are not supported.
- The measurement plug-in UI generated by the tool will exclude controls and indicators for the boolean lists.
- For measurements using VISA instruments, follow the [additional steps](#additional-steps-for-visa-instruments) after conversion.

### Measurement Plug-In UI Creator

- Open Command Prompt.
