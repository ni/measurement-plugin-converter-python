# NI Measurement Plug-In Converter for Python

### Description

- NI Measurement Plug-In Converter for Python is a CLI tool to convert Python measurements to NI measurement plug-ins.

### Code Setup

- Clone the repository using `git clone <repository link>`.
- Check out to the required branch using `git checkout <branch name>`

### Setup Virtual Environment

- Open terminal.
- Run `cd python-code-migration-utility`
- Run `poetry env use <Python exe path>`
- Run `poetry shell` to activate virtual environment.
- Run `pip install dependencies\<whl files>`.
- Run `poetry install` to install dependency files.

### Installation

- Run the `install.bat` file by double clicking it. Ensure all the dependencies files are placed parallel to `install.bat`

### Example usage

- Run `ni-measurement-plugin-converter --help` to know required CLI arguments.
```
Usage: ni-measurement-plugin-converter [OPTIONS]

  NI Measurement Plug-In Converter is a Command Line tool to convert     
  Python measurements to measurement plug-ins.

Options:
  -d, --display-name TEXT         Display name.  [required]
  -m, --measurement-file-dir TEXT
                                  Measurement file directory.  [required]
  -f, --function TEXT             Measurement function name.  [required]
  -o, --output-dir TEXT           Output directory.  [required]
  -h, --help                      Show this message and exit.
```
- Run `ni-measurement-plugin-converter -d <display name> -m <measurement file directory> -f <measurement function name> -o <output directory>` to convert Python measurement to measurement plug-in.


### Prerequisites

The Python measurement should
- Contain a measurement function which should
  - Contain a return value. The return value should be a variable and not a direct function call or constant value.
  ```
  # Not supported
  def function(voltage: int, current: float) -> List[float]:
    # Measurement logic
    voltage_and_current = [voltage, current]
    return measure_voltages()


  # Supported
  def function(voltage: int, current: float) -> List[float]:
    # Measurement logic
    voltage_and_current = [voltage, current]
    voltages = measure_voltage()
    return voltages

  ```
  - Have properly type hinted inputs and outputs.
  ```
  # Not supported
  def function(voltage, current):
    # Measurement logic
    voltage_and_current = [voltage, current]
    return voltage_and_current
  
  # Supported
  def function(voltage: int, current: float) -> List[float]:
    # Measurement logic
    voltage_and_current = [voltage, current]
    return voltage_and_current

  ```
  - Use one of the supported drivers.
- Initialize the instrument driver's session inside the measurement function and within the next level of indentation.
```
# Not supported
def function(voltage: int, current:float) -> float:
  for generate_voltage in range(len(voltage)):
    with nidcpower.Session(resource_name) as session:
      return current

# Supported
def function(voltage: int, current:float) -> float:
  with nidcpower.Session(resource_name) as session:
    return current
```
- All the driverâ€™s session must be initialized at a single point using context manager `with` in Python.

```
# Not supported
def function(voltage: int, current:float) -> float:
  for generate_voltage in range(len(voltage)):
    with nidcpower.Session(resource_name) as dcpower_session:
      with nidmm.Session(resource_name) as dmm_session:
        return current

# Supported
def function(voltage: int, current:float) -> float:
  with nidcpower.Session(resource_name) as dcpower_session, nidmm.Session(resource_name) as dmm_session:
    return current

```
